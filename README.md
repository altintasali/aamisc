# aamisc
Miscellaneous R functions by Ali Altintas. The functions with a good use will be first published in this package. Who knows, maybe they will magically appear in future packages as well. Until that day, this is their home. 

## Install
Please install `devtools` if you haven't yet.
```r
install.packages("devtools")
```
Then, you basically install the `aamisc` package by using:
```r
library(devtools)
install_github("altintasali/aamisc")
```
